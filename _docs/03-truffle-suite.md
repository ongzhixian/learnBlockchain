# Truffle Suite

Truffle is a suite of tools for building and testing smart contracts.
Use the Truffle tool suite to test Ethereum contracts before you deploy them to public ledgers and incur real costs. 
To make your work as a developer easier, develop locally. 
The tool suite includes Truffle, Ganache, and Drizzle. 

1.  Truffle 
2.  Ganache (pronounce- guh-nash)
3.  Drizzle



## Truffle

Truffle is the most popular development environment and testing framework for Ethereum. 


### Install 

You can install Truffle by using the node package manager. In the terminal, type:

`npm install -g truffle`

To confirm that Truffle is installed, type:

`truffle`

There is also a "Trufflefor VS Code" extension by ConsenSys Software Inc"

## Ganache

The most popular local Ethereum blockchain is Ganache. 
You can use Ganache to develop, deploy, and test in a safe and deterministic environment. 
Ganache can be used from the command line, programmatically via Node.js, or in the browser.

### Install

npm install ganache --global

After Ganache is installed, run:

ganache


By default, the blockchain generated by ganache has 10 generated accounts. 
Each account:
    1.  receives 100 test ether to use. 
    2.  has a corresponding private key. 
    3.  has a mnemonic. A mnemonic is a unique 12-word phrase that provides access to the wallet and allows transactions to be made from the account.

The output also displays the blockchain's address. 
We'll use this address to connect to the blockchain. 
By default, the address is 127.0.0.1:8545.

## Truffle commands

Common commands:

`truffle build`
`truffle migrate`
`truffle test`
